An air-cushion vehicle or ACV also known as A hovercraft, is an amphibious craft capable of travelling over land, water, mud, ice, and other surfaces. An air-cushion vehicle which is used to break ice layers on the surface of rivers, lakes &amp; even on the land in polar countries. This vehicle uses air pressure to create cracks in the ice surface &amp; then the crack propagates in the direction where there is least resistance.  To create a crack in the ice-surface minimum air pressure is required to be exerted by the vehicle. E.R. Muller presented an equation with few variables to calculate the pressure. Mullerâ€™s equation can be solved using Newton- Rapson Method.
